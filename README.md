* PYTHON PROJECT WE CREATE THIS README TO INDICATE WHAT THE PROGRAM IS USED FOR AND THE FUNCTIONALITY

The program allows the user to enter a number.
Then check if the number is not negative.
If the number is negative, informs the user that the square roots of negative numbers are not defined.
If the number is not negative, calculate the square root using the math.sqrt() function.
Finally, it prints the calculated square root or an error message depending on the number entered.

# Executing Python Script to Calculate Square Root via Terminal
Preparation:
Ensure Python is installed on your computer.

Create the File:
* Copy the Python code provided into a text editor.
* Save the file with a .py extension, e.g., calculate_square_root.py.
* Execute the Script via Terminal:
Open Terminal:

Unix/Linux: Use Applications/Utilities folder or Ctrl + Alt + T.
macOS: Find in Applications/Utilities or Spotlight (Cmd + Space, "Terminal").
Navigate to Directory:

* Use cd to reach calculate_square_root.py, e.g., cd Desktop.
Run the Script:

* Command: python calculate_square_root.py.
Enter Number:

* Prompted to input a number and hit Enter.
Result Display:

* Output displays square root, handles negatives.
This method ensures effective Python script execution from terminal, calculating square roots directly via command line.
